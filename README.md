Appwrite is an open-source backend-as-a-service platform offering secure authentication (email/password, OAuth, SMS, magic links), databases, file storage with compression/encryption, real-time messaging, serverless functions, and static site hosting via Appwrite Sites—all managed through a unified console and microservices architecture.

Expo is an open-source platform for building universal native apps (Android, iOS, web) using JavaScript/TypeScript and React Native. It features file-based routing via Expo Router, fast refresh, native modules for camera/maps/notifications, over-the-air updates (EAS), and streamlined app deployment.

NativeWind brings Tailwind CSS to React Native and Expo, allowing you to style mobile components using utility-first classes for fast, consistent, and responsive UI design.

React Native is a framework for building mobile UIs with React. It enables component‑based, cross-platform development with declarative UI, deep native API support, and is tightly integrated with Expo for navigation and native capabilities.

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework enabling rapid UI design via low-level classes. In React Native/Expo, it’s commonly used with NativeWind to apply Tailwind-style utilities to mobile components.

TypeScript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript providing type annotations, interfaces, enums, generics, and enhanced tooling. It improves error detection, code quality, and scalability—ideal for robust, maintainable projects.

Zustand is a minimal, hook-based state management library for React and React Native. It lets you manage global state with zero boilerplate, no context providers, and excellent performance through selective state subscriptions.

Sentry is a powerful error tracking and performance monitoring tool for React Native apps. It helps you detect, diagnose, and fix issues in real-time to improve app stability and user experience.
